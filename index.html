            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>Also known as “Korean Thanksgiving,” Chuseok is a three-day harvest festival celebrated by spending time with family and relatives. Celebrating Chuseok is about honoring family ancestors; one way this is done is by paying tribute to the ancestors through an honorary feast with a table filled from East to West with traditional dishes. Those who work in major cities like Seoul, often make the pilgrimage back to their ancestrial hometowns to celebrate the Festival with their loved ones.</p>

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p> Sonpyeon (pictured) is the dish most commonly associated with Chuseok. These half moon-shaped rice cakes with sweet sesame seed filling are a staple to any Chuseok celebration. Another traditional dish is Gujeolpan (Platter of Nine Delicacies), a dish originating from the Yi Dynasty. These dishes are prepared in a specific order and are arranged on the table based on ancient customs in order to thank the ancestors for their protection and favor.</p>

            <h2>Thanks</h2>
            <p>Chuseok is deeply rooted in traditional ancestral worship - the first morning of the Festival, family units begin the day with <em>chayre</em>, a ritual that gives thanks to the ancestors and to the bountiful harvest. This ritual is followed by a feast to repay the ancestors for their protection.</p>
